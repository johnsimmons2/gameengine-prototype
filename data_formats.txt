Entities can be made as JSON objects and parsed inside a level loader

{
  "type":"static",
  "texture":"texture.png",
  "source":"0, 0, 200, 200, 45",
  .
  .
  .
}

containing other such properties. Source being indices of image to use followed by angle of rotation to use as default.

Textures should contain rotation angles and flags for flipping vertical and horizontal.

Tilesheets could be marked with

"tilesheet":"true",
"size":"16, 2, 2",
"source":"1"

so we know each cell is 16x16 pixels and the source tile for the given entity is found in the first 16x16 cell where the image is 2 rows by 2 columns of such cells.
